This project on creating dashboards on excel
Overview 

Data about bike purchases from North America, Europe, and the Pacific is analyzed in this research.
In order to examine data on bike buyers, 1027 rows of data were examined, including ID, income, gender, marital status, number of children, education, occupation, home ownership, cars, commute distance, region, age, and purchased bike.

ANALYSIS 

I started by making a brand-new worksheet and naming it the "bike buyers work sheet." I clean up the data in Excel from this new work sheet.

DATA CLEANING 

1) I started by eliminating every duplication (there were 26 altogether).

2) Secondly, I changed M and S to Married and Single in the column Marital status using the find and replace feature.

3) Modifies the gender column by changing F and M to Female and Male, respectively.

4) I made a new age column and called it Age Brackets. I divided the ages into three categories using the IF function: adolescence, middle age, and old age.

VISUALISATION

1)	Created a pivot table to help build visualizations. 

2)	Used several KPIâ€™s to create the visualization.

3)	First Visualization created is the Average number of buyers by Female and Male

4)	Secondly, the Count of persons who purchase bikes

5)	Thirdly, count of persons who purchased bikes by age group

After that, I created the dashboard in Excel and called it the Bike Sales Dashboard. All of the generated visuals were copied and pasted into my dashboard. 

I then went ahead and added slicers for education, region, and marital status. After that, I applied the slicers to every dashboard visualization.


Please feel free to critique my work; doing so will help me get better at future Excel tasks.
